    <img src="pyramidal.png" alt="pyramidal model" class="pyramidal">

    <p> Here are the explanations of each type of support system, from the lowest hierarchy to the highest: </p>

    <h6 class="second_sections"> TPS | Transaction Processing System </h6>
    <p> Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) monitor, collect, store, and process data from basic business transactions, such as interactions between employees, customers, and suppliers. They continuously gather and organize data, often in real time, forming the foundation for other information systems like MIS. TPS is essential for core operations, with applications including payroll and reservation systems. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> MIS | Management Information System </h6>
    <p> Management Information Systems (MIS) use data from TPS to help middle managers make informed decisions. They focus on providing reports on past and current performance, with limited analytical capabilities. MIS gives easy access to financial and marketing information. Applications include budgeting and sales management systems. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> DSS | Decision Support System </h6>
    <p> Decision Support Systems (DSS) analyze existing information to help managers assess the potential effects of their decisions. Applications include logistics systems and financial planning systems. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> EIS | Executive Information System </h6>
    <p> Executive Information Systems (EIS) help senior executives and management easily access information to make high-level decisions that align with the organization’s goals. They facilitate the flow of information from both internal and external sources and are tailored to analyze long-term trends relevant to the organization’s environment. </p>
