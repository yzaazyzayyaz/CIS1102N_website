    <h3 class="section_headers"> Hardware </h3>
    <div class="p4_s1_A">
      <h5 class="mini_sections"> Introduction </h5>
          <p> Hardware refers to the tangible components of a computer. It enables the operation of a computer system and helps carry out important functions such as input and output, storage, processing, and more. 
      </p>
          <h5 class="mini_sections"> Internal and External Hardware </h5>
          <h6 class="second_sections"> Internal Hardware </h6>
          <p> Internal hardware components process and store instructions delivered by operating system software. Below are examples and brief descriptions of internal hardware components: </p>
          <p> The MOTHERBOARD is a circuit board that holds the CPU and other essential internal components. It serves as the central hub that all other components run through. </p>
          <p> The CPU or CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT serves as the brain of the computer. It processes and executes digital instructions across various programs. </p>
          <p> RAM or RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY is a computer's temporary memory storage. This is also known as volatile memory, which means that when the computer is powered off, data stored in RAM is cleared. </p>
          <p> The HARD DISK DRIVE is a traditional storage medium for computers that utilizes spinning magnetic disks to store both permanent and temporary data. </p>
          <p> The SOLID STATE DRIVE is a non-volatile storage device that can store data even when the computer is turned off. It stores data without the use of moving parts; hence, it is faster, more durable, and less power-consuming compared to the hard disk drive. </p>
          <p> The HEAT SINK is usually installed directly above the CPU. It draws heat away from components and regulates their temperature, ensuring that internal components continue to function properly. </p>
          <p> The NETWORK INTERFACE CARD is a circuit board or chip that allows the computer to connect to a network (typically an Ethernet network). </p>
          <p> The GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT processes graphical data, acting as an extension to the main CPU. </p>

          <h6 class="second_sections"> External Hardware </h6>
          <p> External hardware refers to components that are externally connected to the computer to control input/output functions. The following are examples of external hardware: </p>
          <p> The MOUSE is a hand-held device (that is either wired or wireless) that allows users to move a cursor around a computer screen. </p>
          <p> The KEYBOARD is an input device that enables users to input text, numbers, or special characters into the computer. Popular keyboard layouts include QWERTY and DVORAK. </p>
          <p> The MICROPHONE enables audio communication by converting sound waves into electrical signals. </p>
          <p> The CAMERA captures visual images and streams them to the computer through a network device. </p>
          <p> The TOUCHPAD is an input device used to control the pointer on a display screen. </p>
          <p> The USB FLASH DRIVE is an external, removable storage device that uses flash memory and is attached to the computer through a USB port. </p>

    <div class="p4_s1_B">
      <h5 class="mini_sections"> Maintenance and Troubleshooting </h5>
      <h6 class="second_sections"> Common Issues Surrounding Hardware </h6>
      <p> KEYBOARD FAILURE: occurs when certain keys do not respond to any actions. It is often caused by dust and/or rust buildup over time, or liquid spillage onto the keyboard. </p>
      <p> DISPLAY SCREEN IMAGE DISTORTIONS: manifests through physical cracks on the screen or vertical line distortions - these are often caused by negligent user practices such as dropping the computer. </p>
      <p> COMPUTER OVERHEATING: telltale signs of overheating include unexpected shutdowns, noisy fans, and warm temperatures emanating from the computer. This occurs when internal components generate more heat than can be dissipated by the heat sink </p>
      <h6 class="second_sections"> Common Maintenance Practices </h6>
      <p> Regular cleaning and dusting </p>
      <p> Dust and dirt can accumulate on hardware over time, causing corrosion, malfunction, and overheating. Cleaning and dusting the hardware can prevent such issues and extend hardware lifespan. </p> 
      <p> Replacing and upgrading hardware components </p>
      <p> Identify compatible and suitable hardware components for the computer, and emember to follow installation instructions and test its functionality afterwards </p>
      <h5 class="mini_sections"> Current Hardware Trends </h5>
      <p> AI-powered hardware </p>
      <p> Processors and chips are being designed with artificial intelligences capabilities, enabling the creation of intelligent devices (also known as “AI chips”). </p>
      <p> NVMe SSD Devices </p>
      <p> Nonvolatile memory express devices that allow solid-state drives to store and transfer data faster and more efficiently, which helps computers run demanding applications with minimal delays </p>

    <h3 class="section_headers"> Software </h3>
    <h5 class="mini_sections"> Definition and Importance of Software </h5>
    <p> Software refers to intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to run. They serve as the medium between user requirements and the development of these requirements. </p>
    <h5 class="mini_sections"> Types of Software </h5>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> System Software </h6>
    <p> System Software are used to start and run computer systems and networks.
