      <p class="explanation">Number systems are the fundamental building blocks for representing and manipulating numerical information, allowing us to express abstract mathematical concepts through tangible symbols. These systems play unique roles in different applicationsâ€”from everyday calculations to advanced computer programming. Dive into the number systems and understand how they propel human understanding and achievement.</p>

      <h5 class="mini_sections"> Definition </h5>
      <p> A number system is a set of rules and symbols used to represent and manipulate numbers. It serves as the foundation for expressing mathematical ideas in a clear and tangible way, which is essential for understanding abstract concepts in mathematics. </p>
      <h5 class="mini_sections"> POSITIONAL vs NON-POSITIONAL Number Systems </h5>
      <div class="rowB">
        <div class="columnB">
          <p> A positional number system is one where the value of each digit depends on its position within the number and the base of the system. In this system, each digit's value is determined by the digit itself, its position, and the base being used, with values represented as increasing powers of the base. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="columnB">
          <p> In a non-positional number system, numeric values are represented by adding or increasing the symbols used through tallies. Each symbol represents a unique value, and the order of symbols determine the overall value.

    <h5 class="mini_sections"> Types of Number Systems </h5>
    <p> The 4 most-used common number systems are BINARY, OCTAL, DECIMAL, and HEXADECIMAL. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> Binary </h6>
    <p> The word "binary" comes from the Latin word <i> bini </i>, meaning "two each." It is a base-2 number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. In this system, data is transmitted through electrical pulses, where 1 represents "on" and 0 represents "off." Proposed by Gottfried Leibniz in the late 1700s, the binary system forms the foundation for how computers and digital devices store and process data. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> Octal </h6>
    <p> The word "octal" is derived from the Latin word <i> octo </i>, meaning "eight." It is a base-8 number system that uses digits 0 through 7. One advantage of octal is its ability to display binary data more efficiently and with fewer computational errors, especially in digital transmission systems, where dealing with long strings of binary numbers can be tedious and error-prone. Octal is also used in computer programming, digital systems, and the aviation sector. In aviation, for example, octal codes are used to differentiate aircraft on radar screens, with transponders transmitting four-digit octal codes to ground-based stations. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> Decimal </h6>
    <p> The word "decimal" is derived from the Latin word <i> decem </i>, meaning "ten." It is a base-10 number system that uses ten digits (0 through 9). The decimal system originated in India and spread globally through Arabic trade. It is the most commonly used number system in modern civilization, as it is how we perform most of our computations in everyday life across various fields. The decimal system is also used in scientific notation to accurately represent measurements. </p>
    <h6 class="second_sections"> Hexadecimal </h6>
    <p> The word "hexadecimal" is derived from the Greek word <i> hex </i>meaning six and the Latin word <i> decem </i> meaning ten. It is a base-16 number system that uses digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F. Hexadecimal is commonly used to represent and store very large numbers in computer systems, as one byte can be represented with just two hexadecimal digits, whereas binary would require eight digits. It is also used to represent colors in computers, with the format #RRGGBB, where each primary color (red, green, blue) is characterized by two hexadecimal digits. </p>
